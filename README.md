Git workflow improvement CLI tool inspired by [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit). **This project is still under initial development**, but I am actively [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) it and features *should* be added relatively quickly.

## Aims

Primarily, this is a personal project since I recently switched to Neovim from Emacs and miss the simplicity and efficiency of using Magit. However, I do have some general aims, which are subject to change:

- [x] Simple - uncluttered UI.
- [x] Intuitive - it should be easy to learn to use gex.
- [x] Cross platform - primary focus on Linux, but should work well on Windows and MacOS.
- [ ] Configurable - certain preferences in gex should be configurable to suit your own workflow.
- [ ] Comprehensive\* - you should be able to use gex to do everything you can do in git.

\* gex supports executing arbitrary git commands with <kbd>:</kbd> for when something is not yet available

## Installation

[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix): `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.gex`

### Building from source

Gex is hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/gex). You can either install from source, or you can use cargo:

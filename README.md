_This repository has moved to
[codeberg.org/Piturnah/gex](https://codeberg.org/Piturnah/gex)_

It would mean a lot to me if you joined the discussion over at
[codeberg.org/Piturnah/gex](https://codeberg.org/Piturnah/gex).

## Why [codeberg](https://codeberg.org)?

I build open-source tools because I want to give back to the general public
by improving our collective software stack. Codeberg is an alternative to
GitHub that is better aligned with this perspective.

GitHub, run by Microsoft, is profit-oriented capitalist software that fundamentally 
[operates against](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) the principles of free software. 
Codeberg is a nonprofit association controlled democratically by its members, 
running on open source software (forgejo). It aims to federate with other 
forgejo instances when this is implemented, helping to decentralise the 
web and decrease reliance on monolithic services like GitHub.

Codeberg is based on a fully open-source stack, is run by a non-profit,
and has no other ancillary for-profit products that it is trying to sell using
its platform.

## Why migrate `gex`?

Of all my tools, `gex` is the one that is most specifically targetted at
developers, and developers are the ones who need to spark a change in which
platforms the open source community adopts. If you're here, you're the
person who needs to drive the change toward better software ecosystem
diversity and I believe the best alternative at this moment is
[codeberg](https://codeberg.org).
